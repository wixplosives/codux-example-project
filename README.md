# Wix Component Studio Example Project

This project was created to showcase the capabilities of Wix Component Studio (WCS). It is ready to use straight out of the box, and contains some interesting components and use cases to demonstrate what WCS is capable of.

The project simulates an e-commerce application, where the individual components included in this repository, when rendered together, make up the application's product collection page. You'll find that most of the inner components in this project come with simulations to demonstrate various states and views.

## Getting Started

This project requires the WCS desktop application to view the simulations. You can find the latest release for your system [here](https://www.wixcomponentstudio.com/download) (contact us for the password).

After installing the desktop application, it can be cloned per the steps outlined inÂ [WCS Example Project Explained](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/wcs-example-project-explained), where you'll also find a detailed breakdown of the example project in the context of WCS.

Enjoy!
