# Wix Component Studio Example Project

This project was created to showcase the capabilities of Wix Component Studio (WCS). It has been preconfigured to work with WCS, and contains some interesting components and use cases to demonstrate what WCS is capable of.

The project simulates an e-commerce application, where the individual components included in this repository, when rendered together, make up the application's product collection page. You'll find that most of the inner components in this project come with simulations to demonstrate various states and views.

## Getting Started

This project requires the WCS desktop application to view the simulations. Install the WCS desktop app by running the OS-relevant executable (contact us for the latest release).

After installing the desktop application, it can be cloned per the steps outlined inÂ [WCS Example Project Explained](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/wcs-example-project-explained), where you'll also find a detailed breakdown of the example project in the context of WCS.

Enjoy!
