# Wix Component Studio Example Project

This ready-made example project was created to showcase the capabilities of Wix Component Studio (WCS). It simulates an e-commerce application built from of a series of components that together create the AppProductsCollectionPage root component.

You'll find that this project is preconfigured to work with WCS, and contains some interesting components and use cases to demonstrate what WCS is capable of. Most of the inner components come with pre-made simulations to demonstrate various states and views.

The project can be opened by the WCS desktop application after cloning it. The only prerequisite that it requires is that the WCS desktop application be [installed and configured](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/installation-and-configuration).

## Getting Started

After setting up the desktop application per the link above, clone the demo project in the working directory as follows:
```console
git clone https://github.com/wixplosives/wcs-example-project.git
```
Move into the new directory:
```
cd wcs-example-project
```
Run yarn to install the required dependencies for the project:
```
yarn
```

Now open the WCS desktop app and select "Add Project". Browse to the 'wcs-example-project' folder and click "Add".

Enjoy!
