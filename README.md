# Wix Component Studio Example Project

This project was created to showcase the capabilities of Wix Component Studio (WCS). It has been preconfigured to work with WCS, and contains some interesting components and use cases to demonstrate what WCS is capable of.

The project simulates an e-commerce application. Most of the inner components come with simulations to demonstrate various states and views. Individual components in this project, when rendered together, make up the application's product collection page (see the AppProductsCollectionPage component in WCS).

The only prerequisite required prior to cloning this project is that the WCS desktop application is first [installed and configured](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/installation-and-configuration).

## Getting Started

After setting up the desktop application per the link above, clone the demo project in the working directory as follows:
```console
git clone https://github.com/wixplosives/wcs-example-project.git
```
Move into the new directory:
```console
cd wcs-example-project
```
Run yarn to install the required dependencies for the project:
```console
yarn
```

Now open the WCS desktop app and select "Add Project". Browse to the 'wcs-example-project' folder and click "Add".

Refer to [WCS Example Project Explained](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/wcs-example-project-explained) for a more detailed description and breakdown of this project, as well as how to navigate through the main features of WCS.

Enjoy!
