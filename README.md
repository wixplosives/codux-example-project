# Codux Example Project

This project simulates an e-commerce application. It is ready for you to use, and enables us to showcase the capabilities of Codux. Use this example to get a feel for Codux, and see how easy and fun it is to build and simulate components with it.

The project includes all the components and boards you might want to see in different states and views - be sure to check out how the included components look in different screen sizes and environmental conditions!

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of the Codux desktop application to get started. You can find the latest release for your system [here](https://www.codux.com) (contact us for the password).

After installing the desktop application, have a look at [Codux Example Project Explained](https://codux.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/trying-out-the-example-project), where you can find more information about the project and the steps required to open it in Codux.

Enjoy!
